Smart Parking Backend API System
Project Overview
This project is a robust backend API system for a smart parking solution, built to manage parking slots, user reservations, and authentication. It is a scaled-down, functional prototype of a real-world system, demonstrating key skills in backend development, database management, and API security.

This project was built with a focus on core features relevant to the urban mobility and car ownership domain, with a particular emphasis on addressing real-world challenges like concurrency in reservations and secure user authentication.

üöÄ Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Supabase's authentication service.

Parking Slot Management: A RESTful API to retrieve a list of all available parking slots.

Secure Reservation System: A protected endpoint that allows an authenticated user to reserve a parking slot. The logic handles availability checks to prevent double-booking.

User-Specific Reservations: A protected API to retrieve all reservations made by the authenticated user.

Cloud-Based Database: Uses Supabase for a scalable and reliable PostgreSQL backend.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Backend: Python 3.11+

Web Framework: FastAPI

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Dependency Management: pip

Environment Variables: python-dotenv

üß± System Architecture
The system follows a standard client-server architecture. The FastAPI backend acts as a microservice, handling all business logic and API routing. It communicates with the Supabase backend, which serves as a centralized database and authentication provider.

Alternatively, you can create a requirements.txt file with the contents below and install it:

fastapi
uvicorn
supabase
python-dotenv
pyjwt
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your Supabase credentials.

Code snippet

SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SECRET_KEY=a_strong_secret_key_for_jwt_signing
Run the server:

Bash

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

üìå API Endpoints
The API is fully documented using Swagger UI, available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Method	Endpoint	Description	Authentication Required
POST	/register	Registers a new user.	No
POST	/login	Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.	No
GET	/parking/slots	Retrieves all available parking slots.	No
POST	/parking/reserve	Reserves an available parking slot.	Yes
GET	/parking/my-reservations	Retrieves all reservations for the authenticated user.	Yes
POST	/parking/slots	Creates a new parking slot (for admin use).	Yes
üöÄ Future Enhancements
Check-out and Payments: Implement a /check-out endpoint to calculate final fees and free up the parking slot.

Email Notifications: Integrate a service to send email notifications for reservation confirmations.

Admin Dashboard: Create endpoints for an admin to manage all parking slots and user reservations.

Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the application for easier deployment.

Cloud Deployment: Deploy the API to a cloud platform like Render, Heroku, or AWS.
